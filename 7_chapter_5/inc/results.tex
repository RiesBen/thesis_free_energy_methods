From the PAMPA and Caco-2 assays performed by our collaborators,\cite{Comeau2021} a large ``permeability cliff''  between Nleu-5R and 5S could be identified (Figure \ref{fig:permAssays}). Permeability cliffs were also observed between some other pairs of epimers, but to a lesser extent (e.g., Nala-4R vs 4S with $−log(P_e)$~=~$7.6$ and $6.6$, Nphe-2R vs 2S with $−log(P_e)$~=~$7.2$ and $6.3$, and Nphe-3R vs 3S with $−log(P_e)$~=~$7.5$ and $6.5$). 
Extensive MD simulations were carried out in a polar and apolar environment (i.e., water and chloroform) to study the influence of the stereocenter change on the conformational behavior of the molecules. As a negative control group, we used the molecule pair Nleu-2R and 2S.

\subsection{Starting Configurations} 
The starting conformations used for the MD simulations were generated with the macrocycle variant of the OMEGA conformer generator from OpenEye.  \cite{Hawkins2012, Hawkins2010, Poongavanam2018}
The generated conformers showed similar distributions in terms of hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) and backbone torsional angles for the enantiomer pairs (Tables \ref{tab: SIhbondRatios} and \ref{tab: SIhbondAmountRatios}).
Therefore, we started the MD simulations for each enantiomer pair from similar starting points.
In these conformer ensembles, approximately $50\%$ of the structures had a trans-peptoid bond for each molecule, and $50\%$ had a cis-peptoid bond.

\subsection{CNN Clustering} 
The cumulative 25~$\mu$s simulation data for each peptide and solvent were clustered separately based on the backbone dihedrals and the polar atom distances. The resulting clusters could be structurally classified depending on the conformation of the peptoid bond (i.e., cis or trans; see Tables \ref{tab:SIClusterTransCHCL3} and \ref{tab: SIClusterTransWater}). The number of generated clusters varied but usually the size of the clusters decreased rapidly. Conformations with a cis or trans-peptoid bond were cleanly separated into different clusters.

The cis-trans isomerization represents a very slow process in the simulations, which occurred only rarely (Table \ref{tab: SICisTransTrans}). Due to the low number of transitions, the process could not be modeled robustly. Therefore, the clusters with the cis- and trans-peptoid bond are analyzed separately in the following.

\subsection{NMR Validation}
The NMR experiments in chloroform-d (CDCl$_3$) showed that the four compounds adopt at least two different conformations in solution. \cite{Comeau2021}
The major conformer was identified with all amides in trans conformation. 
It was not possible to assign the minor conformers due to signal overlap and low intensity. In the case of Nleu-5R and Nleu-5S, a third conformer could be identified based on exchange spectroscopy (EXSY) cross-peaks in the nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) spectrum, which is barely detectable in the $^1$H spectrum. The corresponding conformer ratios are listed in Table \ref{tab: nmrConfRatios}.  

\begin{table}[h!]
    \centering
    \caption{Ratios of conformer population observed in the NMR spectra (CDCl$_3$).}
    \label{tab: nmrConfRatios}
    \begin{adjustbox}{max width=\textwidth}

    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \end{adjustbox}
\end{table}

The results from the MD simulations were compared to the NMR data of the major conformer, in particular the $^3J_{\text{HN–H}\alpha}$ coupling constants (Figure \ref{fig: j3NMRConfClusterAna}) and the NOE-derived interproton distances (Tables \ref{fig: SINOE violations Nleu-5R} - \ref{fig: SINOE violations Nleu-2SII}).

    \label{fig: j3NMRConfClusterAna}
\end{figure}

The clusters with all amides in trans conformation are in good agreement with the  $^3J_{\text{HN–H}\alpha}$ coupling constants (Figure \ref{fig: j3NMRConfClusterAna}), whereas the clusters containing the cis-peptoid bond deviate significantly from the experimental values. For Nleu-2R, the $^3J_{\text{HN–H}\alpha}$ coupling analysis is missing as we could not determine the $^3J_{\text{HN–H}\alpha}$ couplings reliably due to line broadening in the spectrum. The NOE-derived upper distance bounds are also generally reproduced in these clusters (Figures \ref{fig: SINOE violations Nleu-5S} -\ref{fig: SINOE violations Nleu-2SII}). Based on these findings, we focused the analysis in the following on those clusters, which have a reasonable agreement with the NMR data (i.e., clusters 1 and 4 for Nleu-5R, clusters 1, 5, and 6 for Nleu-5S, cluster 1 for Nleu-2R, and clusters 1 and 2 for Nleu-2S).

A necessary condition for good membrane permeability is the adoption of conformations that shield polar groups optimally from the apolar environment. \cite{Sebastiano2018, Alex2011, Tyagi2018}
Therefore, we first analyzed the hydrogen-bonding patterns in the clusters in chloroform. For the peptides in this study, a maximum number of two H-bonds can be formed in a conformation due to ring strain. As can be seen in Table \ref{tab: hbondsratio}, the percentage of sampled conformations with two H-bonds differs significantly between Nleu-5R ($30\%$) and Nleu-5S ($7\%$). At the same time, the percentage of conformations without a H-bond is increased for Nleu-5S ($25\%$) compared to Nleu-5R ($8\%$). For the other pair, Nleu-2R and Nleu-2S, the percentages are more similar and in between those of Nleu-5R and Nleu-5S.

For a given molecule in an apolar environment, having access to conformations in which polar groups are shielded -- such as by H-bonding -- should be energetically favorable. 
To assess this effect, we extracted the potential energy of the peptides (i.e., intramolecular and peptide-solvent contributions) from the trajectories. 
The normality of each potential-energy distribution was confirmed by the Shapiro–Wilk test \cite{Shapiro1965} (Table \ref{tab: SIstatTestingNorm}).

The Fisher t-test \cite{Kotz1998} was employed to determine if the means of the distributions differ statistically significantly ($p < 0.05$). 
This was found to be the case for each pair of distributions (Table \ref{tab: SIstatTestingDiff}). 
On average, the potential energy of Nleu-5R is $9$~kJ/mol lower (i.e., more favorable) in chloroform compared to Nleu-5S, whereas the difference in the average potential energy between Nleu-2R and Nleu-2S is $6$~kJ/mol. In many studies in the literature, it was found that the 3D-PSA is a good measure for the degree of polar shielding in conformations. \cite{Roux2020, Sebastiano2018, Vorherr2018, Peraro2018} 
However, for the present set of four peptides, no correlation was observed between the 3D-PSA and the potential energy (Figure \ref{fig: SI3DPSAANA}). 
The ring strain in the relatively small backbone cycle of the peptides affects the geometry of the intramolecular H-bonds, which is likely not reflected appropriately in the 3D-PSA calculation.

In summary, the ranking Nleu-5R $<$ Nleu-2S $<$ Nleu-2R $<$ Nleu-5S, which was found in terms of both hydrogen-bonding patterns and potential energies, matches well with the experimental permeability data.
The findings described above indicate that the change in stereochemistry of the methyl group in position $5$ between Nleu-5R and Nleu-5S leads to different conformational behavior. 
A detailed analysis of the H-bonds showed that only Nleu-5S forms a H-bond between Ala-O and the tether-NH with an occurrence of $24\%$ in chloroform (Table \ref{tab: hbondsrationCLCH3}). 
This H-bond across the ring of Nleu-5S prevents the formation of other H-bonds (Figure \ref{fig: HbondExamples}B).
Such a conformation with a single H-bond is likely less favorable (compared to one with more H-bonds) in chloroform because less polar groups are shielded. In the dominant conformation of Nleu-5R, on the other hand, two H-bonds can be formed across the ring (Figure \ref{fig: HbondExamples}A).

Next, we analyzed the torsional-angle distributions in the backbone ring of the peptides. The change in stereochemistry of the methyl group at position 5 leads to a shift in the torsional-angle distributions of the tether units for Nleu-5S compared to Nleu-5R (Figure \ref{fig: dihedralDist}A). This shift results in a bent conformation of the ring (Figure \ref{fig: dihedralDist}B), which allows only one H-bond to form between Ala-O and tether-NH (Figure \ref{fig: dihedralDist}B). There is also a shift in the backbone torsional-angle distributions between Nleu-2R and Nleu-2S, however, to a much smaller extent (Figure \ref{fig: SITorsion2RS}). Noteably a longrange effect in the dihedral distribution for the phenylalanine residue was detected. The missing hydrogen bond and the resulting rotation of the carbonyl group seem to hinder the free rotation of the phenylalanine rest (Figure \ref{fig: dihedralDistSubst}).

(\textbf{B}) Torsional angles of the tether (shown in cyan and orange) corresponding to the peaks of the distributions. Pictures were generated with PyMol. \cite{Delano2020} The change in the stereocenter also affects the $\chi_1$-angle of the phenylalanine residue as the tether conformation hinders the rotation around this torsion due to a steric clash with the carbonyl group that is facing out of the backbone ring (Figure \ref{fig: dihedralDistSubst}).

The analysis of the hydrogen-bonding patterns in water showed a significant decrease for the intramolecular H-bond populations, as they competed with the intermolecular H-bonds to the water. Specifically, Nleu-5R has a higher percentage (about $10\%$) of conformers with no H-bonds compared to Nleu-2R, Nleu-2S, and Nleu-5S (Table \ref{tab: hbondsratiowater}). The conformations containing two intramolecular H-bonds nearly vanished.
The positions of the intramolecular H-bonds are mainly focused on the Nleu-O and tether-NH position (Table \ref{tab: SIhbondRatiosWater}).
Nevertheless, it could be observed that the Ala-O and tether-NH, which was unique to Nleu-5S in the apolar environment, is again most present in water for Nleu-5S in contrast to the other possible intramolecular H-bonds. 
In general, however, no significant differences between the peptides could be observed in water.

The findings, taken together, suggest that the permeability cliff observed between Nleu-5R and Nleu-5S is related to their propensity for conformations with a maximized number of intramolecular H-bonds in the apolar environment. Their ability to adopt such conformations is in turn affected by the stereochemistry of the methyl group at position $5$ in the tether as it determines the preferred torsional angles of the tether.
