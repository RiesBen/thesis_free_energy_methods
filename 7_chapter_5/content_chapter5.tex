\begin{summary}
Incorporating small modifications to peptidic macrocycles can have a major influence on their properties. For instance, N-methylation has been shown to impact permeability. A better understanding of the relationship between permeability and structure is of key importance as peptidic drugs are often associated with unfavorable pharmacokinetic profiles. 

A library consisting of 36 compounds of semipeptidic macrocycles was generated, investigating two small structure changes: peptide-to-peptoid substitution and various methyl placements on the nonpeptidic linker. 
The permeability of those compounds was assessed in parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA) and Caco-2 assays.A permeability cliff was identified triggered by the stereochemistry change based on a single methyl placement. This cliff was studied using a combination of MD simulations and NMR measurements, resulting in a hypothesis on how the change modifies the conformational behavior.
