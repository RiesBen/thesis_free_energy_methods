\begin{abstract}
Incorporating small modifications to peptidic macrocycles can have a major influence on their properties. For instance, N-methylation has been shown to impact permeability. A better understanding of the relationship between permeability and structure is of key importance as peptidic drugs are often associated with unfavorable pharmacokinetic profiles. Starting from a semipeptidic macrocycle backbone composed of a tripeptide tethered head-to-tail with an alkyl linker, we investigated two small changes: peptide-to-peptoid substitution and various methyl placements on the nonpeptidic linker. Implementing these changes in parallel, we created a collection of 36 compounds. Their permeability was then assessed in parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA) and Caco-2 assays. Our results show a systematic improvement in permeability associated with one peptoid position in the cycle, while the influence of methyl substitution varies on a case-by-case basis. Using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and NMR measurements, we offer hypotheses to explain such behavior.
