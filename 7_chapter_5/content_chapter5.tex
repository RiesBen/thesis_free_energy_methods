\begin{summary}
Incorporating small modifications to peptidic macrocycles can have a major influence on their properties. For instance, N-methylation has been shown to impact permeability. A better understanding of the relationship between permeability and structure is of key importance as peptidic drugs are often associated with unfavorable pharmacokinetic profiles. 
%
A library consisting of 36 semipeptidic macrocycles was generated by our collaborators, exploring two small structural changes: peptide-to-peptoid substitution and various methyl placements on the nonpeptidic linker. 
The permeability of these compounds was assessed in parallel artificial membrane permeability assays (PAMPA) and Caco-2 assays. A permeability cliff was identified triggered by the stereochemistry change of a single methyl group in the linker. This cliff was studied using a combination of MD simulations and NMR measurements, resulting in a hypothesis on how the change modifies the conformational behavior of the macrocycles.
