abstract = {The calculation of relative free energies that involve large reorganizations of the environment is one of the great challenges of condensed-phase simulation. Such calculations are of particular importance in protein-ligand free-energy calculations. To meet this challenge, we have developed new free-energy techniques that combine the advantages of the replica-exchange method with free-energy perturbation (FEP) and finite-difference thermodynamic integration (FDTI). These new techniques are tested and compared with FEP, FDTI, and the adaptive umbrella weighted histogram analysis method (AdUmWHAM) on the challenging calculation of the relative hydration free energy of methane and water. This calculation involves a large solvent configurational change. Through the use of replica-exchange moves along the lambda-coordinate, the configurations sampled along lambda are allowed to mix, which leads to dramatic improvements in solvent configurational sampling, an efficient reduction of random sampling error, and a reduction of general simulation error. This is achieved at effectively no extra computational cost, relative to standard FEP or FDTI.},

abstract = {Abstract CHARMM (Chemistry at HARvard Molecular Mechanics) is a highly versatile and widely used molecular simulation program. It has been developed over the last three decades with a primary focus on molecules of biological interest, including proteins, peptides, lipids, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and small molecule ligands, as they occur in solution, crystals, and membrane environments. For the study of such systems, the program provides a large suite of computational tools that include numerous conformational and path sampling methods, free energy estimators, molecular minimization, dynamics, and analysis techniques, and model-building capabilities. The CHARMM program is applicable to problems involving a much broader class of many-particle systems. Calculations with CHARMM can be performed using a number of different energy functions and models, from mixed quantum mechanical-molecular mechanical force fields, to all-atom classical potential energy functions with explicit solvent and various boundary conditions, to implicit solvent and membrane models. The program has been ported to numerous platforms in both serial and parallel architectures. This article provides an overview of the program as it exists today with an emphasis on developments since the publication of the original CHARMM article in 1983. {\textcopyright} 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.J Comput Chem, 2009.},

abstract = {Replica-exchange enveloping distribution sampling (RE-EDS) allows the efficient estimation of free-energy differences between multiple end-states from a single molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. In EDS, a reference state is sampled, which can be tuned by two kinds of parameters, i.e. smoothness parameters(s) and energy offsets, such that all end-states are sufficiently sampled. The choice of these parameters is, however, not trivial. Replica exchange (RE) or parallel tempering is a widely applied technique to enhance sampling. By combining EDS with the RE technique, the parameter choice problem could be simplified and the challenge shifted towards an optimal distribution of the replicas in the smoothness-parameter space. The choice of a certain replica distribution can alter the sampling efficiency significantly. In this work, global round- trip time optimisation (GRTO) algorithms are tested for the use in RE-EDS simulations. In addition, a local round-trip time optimisation (LRTO) algorithm is proposed for systems with slowly adapting environments, where a reliable estimate for the round- trip time is challenging to obtain. The optimisation algorithms were applied to RE-EDS simulations of a system of nine small-molecule inhibitors of phenylethanolamine N -methyltransferase (PNMT). The energy offsets were determined using the recently proposed parallel energy-offset (PEOE) estimation scheme. While multi-state GRTO algorithm yielded the best replica distribution for the ligands in water, the multi-state LRTO algorithm was found to be the method of choice for the ligands in complex with PNMT. With this, the 36 alchemical free-energy differences between the nine ligands were calculated successfully from a single RE-EDS simulation of 10 ns length. RE-EDS presents thus an efficient method for the estimation of relative binding free energies.},

abstract = {We present a new computational approach for constant pH simulations in explicit solvent based on the combination of the enveloping distribution sampling (EDS) and Hamiltonian replica exchange (HREX) methods. Unlike constant pH methods based on variable and continuous charge models, our method is based on discrete protonation states. EDS generates a hybrid Hamiltonian of different protonation states. A smoothness parameter s is used to control the heights of energy barriers of the hybrid-state energy landscape. A small s value facilitates state transitions by lowering energy barriers. Replica exchange between EDS potentials with different s values allows us to readily obtain a thermodynamically accurate ensemble of multiple protonation states with frequent state transitions. The analysis is performed with an ensemble obtained from an EDS Hamiltonian without smoothing, s = ∞, which strictly follows the minimum energy surface of the end states. The accuracy and efficiency of this method is tested on aspartic acid, lysine, and glutamic acid, which have two protonation states, a histidine with three states, a four-residue peptide with four states, and snake cardiotoxin with eight states. The pK a values estimated with the EDS-HREX method agree well with the experimental pK a values. The mean absolute errors of small benchmark systems range from 0.03 to 0.17 pK a units, and those of three titratable groups of snake cardiotoxin range from 0.2 to 1.6 pK a units. This study demonstrates that EDS-HREX is a potent theoretical framework, which gives the correct description of multiple protonation states and good calculated pK a values.},

By careful optimization of neighbor searching and of inner loop performance, GROMACS is a very fast program for molecular dynamics simulation. It does not have a force field of its own, but is compatible with GROMOS, OPLS, AMBER, and ENCAD force fields. In addition, it can handle polarizable shell models and flexible constraints. The program is versatile, as force routines can be added by the user, tabulated functions can be specified, and analyses can be easily customized. Nonequilibrium dynamics and free energy determinations are incorporated. Interfaces with popular quantum-chemical packages (MOPAC, GAMES-UK, GAUSSIAN) are provided to perform mixed MM/QM simulations. The package includes about 100 utility and analysis programs. GROMACS is in the public domain and distributed (with source code and documentation) under the GNU General Public License.

Yet, the reliability of these calculations can often be improved significantly if a number of precepts, or good practices, are followed. Although the theory upon which these good practices rely has largely been known for many years, it is often overlooked or simply ignored. In other cases, the theoretical developments are too recent for their potential to be fully grasped and merged into popular platforms for the computation of free-energy differences. In this contribution, the current best practices for carrying out free-energy calculations using free energy perturbation and nonequilibrium work methods are discussed, demonstrating that at little to no additional cost, free-energy estimates could be markedly improved and bounded by meaningful error estimates. Monitoring the probability distributions that underlie the transformation between the states of interest, performing the calculation bidirectionally, stratifying the reaction pathway, and choosing the most appropriate paradigms and algorithms for transforming between states offer significant gains in both accuracy and precision.},

@article{Hahn2019,
abstract = {A new method is proposed to calculate alchemical free-energy differences based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, called the conveyor belt thermodynamic integration (CBTI) scheme. As in thermodynamic integration (TI), K replicas of the system are simulated at different values of the alchemical coupling parameter . The number K is taken to be even, and the replicas are equally spaced on a forward-turn-backward-turn path, akin to a conveyor belt (CB) between the two physical end-states; and as in -dynamics (D), the -values associated with the individual systems evolve in time along the simulation. However, they do so in a concerted fashion, determined by the evolution of a single dynamical variable ? of period 2$\pi$ controlling the advance of the entire CB. Thus, a change of ? is always associated with K/2 equispaced replicas moving forward and K/2 equispaced replicas moving backward along . As a result, the effective free-energy profile of the replica system along ? is periodic of period 2$\pi$K -1 , and the magnitude of its variations decreases rapidly upon increasing K, at least as K -1 in the limit of large K. When a sufficient number of replicas is used, these variations become small, which enables a complete and quasi-homogeneous coverage of the -range by the replica system, without application of any biasing potential. If desired, a memory-based biasing potential can still be added to further homogenize the sampling, the preoptimization of which is computationally inexpensive. The final free-energy profile along is calculated similarly to TI, by binning of the Hamiltonian -derivative as a function of considering all replicas simultaneously, followed by quadrature integration. The associated quadrature error can be kept very low owing to the continuous and quasi-homogeneous -sampling. The CBTI scheme can be viewed as a continuous/deterministic/dynamical analog of the Hamiltonian replica-exchange/permutation (HRE/HRP) schemes or as a correlated multiple-replica analog of the D or -local elevation umbrella sampling (-LEUS) schemes. Compared to TI, it shares the advantage of the latter schemes in terms of enhanced orthogonal sampling, i.e. the availability of variable- paths to circumvent conformational barriers present at specific -values. Compared to HRE/HRP, it permits a deterministic and continuous sampling of the -range, is expected to be less sensitive to possible artifacts of the thermo- and barostating schemes, and bypasses the need to carefully preselect a -ladder and a swapping-attempt frequency. Compared to -LEUS, it eliminates (or drastically reduces) the dead time associated with the preoptimization of a biasing potential. The goal of this article is to provide the mathematical/physical formulation of the proposed CBTI scheme, along with an initial application of the method to the calculation of the hydration free energy of methanol.},

However, in the charge inversion and the water to methanol conversion, Hamiltonian replica-exchange molecular dynamics of the reference state was necessary to observe transitions in the reference state simulation between the parts of phase space important to A and B, respectively.

abstract = {In the molecular dynamics simulation method for fluids, the equations of motion for a collection of particles in a fixed volume are solved numerically. The energy, volume, and number of particles are constant for a particular simulation, and it is assumed that time averages of properties of the simulated fluid are equal to microcanonical ensemble averages of the same properties. In some situations, it is desirable to perform simulations of a fluid for particular values of temperature and/or pressure or under conditions in which the energy and volume of the fluid can fluctuate. This paper proposes and discusses three methods for performing molecular dynamics simulations under conditions of constant temperature and/or pressure, rather than constant energy and volume. For these three methods, it is shown that time averages of properties of the simulated fluid are equal to averages over the isoenthalpic-isobaric, canonical, and isothermal-isobaric ensembles. Each method is a way of describing the dynamics of a certain number of particles in a volume element of a fluid while taking into account the influence of surrounding particles in changing the energy and/or density of the simulated volume element. The influence of the surroundings is taken into account without introducing unwanted surface effects. Examples of situations where these methods may be useful are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1980 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations of ionic systems require the inclusion of long-range electrostatic forces. We propose an expression for the long-range electrostatic forces based on an analytical solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation outside a spherical cutoff, which can easily be implemented in molecular simulation programs. An analytical solution of the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation valid in a spherical region is obtained. From this general solution special expressions are derived for evaluating the electrostatic potential and its derivative at the origin of the sphere. These expressions have been implemented for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, such that the surface of the cutoff sphere around a charged particle is identified with the spherical boundary of the Poisson-Boltzmann problem. The analytical solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation is valid for the cutoff sphere and can be used for calculating the reaction field forces on the central charge, assuming a uniform continuum of given ionic strength beyond the cutoff. MD simulations are performed for a periodic system consisting of 2127 SPC water molecules with 40 NaCl ions (1 molar). We compare the structural and dynamical results obtained from MD simulations in which the long range electrostatic interactions are treated differently; using a cutoff radius, using a cutoff radius and a Poisson-Boltzmann generalized reaction field force, and using the Ewald summation. Application of the Poisson-Boltzmann generalized reaction field gives a dramatic improvement of the structure of the solution compared to a simple cutoff treatment, at no extra computational cost. {\textcopyright} 1995 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {One reason that free energy difference calculations are notoriously difficult in molecular systems is due to insufficient conformational overlap, or similarity, between the two states or systems of interest. The degree of overlap is irrelevant, however, if the absolute free energy of each state can be computed. We present a method for calculating the absolute free energy that employs a simple construction of an exactly computable reference system which possesses high overlap with the state of interest. The approach requires only a physical ensemble of conformations generated via simulation and an auxiliary calculation of approximately equal central-processing-unit cost. Moreover, the calculations can converge to the correct free energy value even when the physical ensemble is incomplete or improperly distributed. As a "proof of principle," we use the approach to correctly predict free energies for test systems where the absolute values can be calculated exactly and also to predict the conformational equilibrium for leucine dipeptide in implicit solvent. {\textcopyright}2006 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The hallmarks of cancer comprise six biological capabilities acquired during the multistep development of human tumors. The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list - reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the "tumor microenvironment." Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Although our examples should be transferable to other kinds of free energy simulations, we focus on applications of multi-scale free energy simulations. Such calculations are especially complex, since they connect two different levels of theory with very different requirements in terms of speed, accuracy, sampling and parallelisability. We try to reconcile all those different factors by developing some simple criteria to guide the early stages of the development of a free energy protocol. This is accomplished by quantifying how many intermediate steps and how many potential energy evaluations are necessary in order to reach a certain level of convergence.},

abstract = {A recently proposed method to obtain free energy differences for multiple end states from a single simulation of a reference state which was called enveloping distribution sampling (EDS) [J. Chem. Phys. 126, 184110 (2007)] is expanded to situations where the end state configuration space densities do not show overlap. It uses a reference state Hamiltonian suggested by Han in 1992 [Phys. Lett. A 165, 28 (1992)] in a molecular dynamics implementation. The method allows us to calculate multiple free energy differences "on the fly" from a single molecular dynamics simulation. The influence of the parameters on the accuracy and precision of the obtained free energy differences is investigated. A connection is established between the presented method and the Bennett acceptance ratio method. The method is applied to four two-state test systems (dipole inversion, van der Waals perturbation, charge inversion, and water to methanol conversion) and two multiple-state test systems [dipole inversion with five charging states and five (dis-)appearing water molecules]. Accurate results could be obtained for all test applications if the parameters of the reference state Hamiltonian were optimized according to a given algorithm. The deviations from the exact result or from an independent calculation were at most 0.6 kJ/mol. An accurate estimation of the free energy difference is always possible, independent of how different the end states are. However, the convergence times of the free energy differences are longer in cases where the end state configuration space densities do not show overlap [charge inversion, water to methanol conversion, (dis-)appearing water molecules] than in cases where the configuration space densities do show some overlap [(multiple) dipole inversion and van der Waals perturbation].},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulation is a powerful computational technique to study biomolecular systems, which complements experiments by providing insights into the structural dynamics relevant to biological functions at atomic scale. It can also be used to calculate the free energy landscapes of the conformational transitions to better understand the functions of the biomolecules. However, the sampling of biomolecular configurations is limited by the free energy barriers that need to be overcome, leading to considerable gaps between the timescales reached by MD simulation and those governing biological processes. To address this issue, many enhanced sampling methodologies have been developed to increase the sampling efficiency of molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations. Usually, enhanced sampling algorithms can be classified into methods based on collective variables (CV-based) and approaches which do not require predefined CVs (CV-free). In this chapter, the theoretical basis of free energy estimation is briefly reviewed first, followed by the reviews of the most common CV-based and CV-free methods including the presentation of some examples and recent developments. Finally, the combination of different enhanced sampling methods is discussed.},

It belongs to the class of SD algorithms, in which the integration time step t is not limited by the condition t [formula omitted]but only by the properties of the systematic force. It is shown how constraints, such as bond length or bond angle constraints, can be incorporated in the computational scheme. It is argued that the third-order Verlet-type SD algorithm proposed earlier may be simplified without loosing its third-order accuracy. The leap-frog SD algorithm is proven to be equivalent to the verlet-type SD algorithm. Both these SD algorithms are slightly more economical on computer storage than the Beeman-type SD algorithm. {\textcopyright} 1988, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.},

The new method is a significant extension of our previously developed constant-pH simulation method, which is based on enveloping distribution sampling (EDS) coupled with a one-dimensional (1D) Hamiltonian exchange method (HREM). EDS constructs a hybrid Hamiltonian from multiple discrete end state Hamiltonians that, in this case, represent different protonation states of the system. The ruggedness and heights of the hybrid Hamiltonian?s energy barriers can be tuned by the smoothness parameter. Within the context of the 1D EDS-HREM method, exchanges are performed between replicas with different smoothness parameters, allowing frequent protonation-state transitions and sampling of conformations that are favored by the end-state Hamiltonians. In this work, the 1D method is extended to 2D with an additional dimension, external pH. Within the context of the 2D method (2D EDS-HREM), exchanges are performed on a lattice of Hamiltonians with different pH conditions and smoothness parameters. We demonstrate that both the 1D and 2D methods exactly reproduce the thermodynamic properties of the semigrand canonical (SGC) ensemble of a system at a given pH. We have tested our new 2D method on aspartic acid, glutamic acid, lysine, a four residue peptide (sequence KAAE), and snake cardiotoxin.

The GROMACS software consists of a preprocessor, a parallel MD and energy minimization program that can use an arbitrary number of processors (including one), an optional monitor, and several analysis tools. The programs are written in ANSI C and available by ftp (information: gromacs@chem.rug.nl). The functionality is based on the GROMOS (GROningen MOlecular Simulation) package (van Gunsteren and Berendsen, 1987; BIOMOS B.V., Nijenborgh 4, 9747 AG Groningen). Conversion programs between GROMOS and GROMACS formats are included. The MD program can handle rectangular periodic boundary conditions with temperature and pressure scaling. The interactions that can be handled without modification are variable non-bonded pair interactions with Coulomb and Lennard-Jones or Buckingham potentials, using a twin-range cut-off based on charge groups, and fixed bonded interactions of either harmonic or constraint type for bonds and bond angles and either periodic or cosine power series interactions for dihedral angles. Special forces can be added to groups of particles (for non-equilibrium dynamics or for position restraining) or between particles (for distance restraints). The parallelism is based on particle decomposition. Interprocessor communication is largely limited to position and force distribution over the ring once per time step. {\textcopyright}1995.},

abstract = {The accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding free energies remains a significant challenge of central importance in computational biophysics and structure-based drug design. Multiple recent advances including the development of greatly improved protein and ligand molecular mechanics force fields, more efficient enhanced sampling methods, and low-cost powerful GPU computing clusters have enabled accurate and reliable predictions of relative protein-ligand binding free energies through the free energy perturbation (FEP) methods. However, the existing FEP methods can only be used to calculate the relative binding free energies for R-group modifications or single-atom modifications and cannot be used to efficiently evaluate scaffold hopping modifications to a lead molecule. Scaffold hopping or core hopping, a very common design strategy in drug discovery projects, is critical not only in the early stages of a discovery campaign where novel active matter must be identified but also in lead optimization where the resolution of a variety of ADME/Tox problems may require identification of a novel core structure. In this paper, we introduce a method that enables theoretically rigorous, yet computationally tractable, relative protein-ligand binding free energy calculations to be pursued for scaffold hopping modifications. We apply the method to six pharmaceutically interesting cases where diverse types of scaffold hopping modifications were required to identify the drug molecules ultimately sent into the clinic. For these six diverse cases, the predicted binding affinities were in close agreement with experiment, demonstrating the wide applicability and the significant impact Core Hopping FEP may provide in drug discovery projects.},

No computer time has to be spent on the simulation of intermediate states. Only one state is sampled, i.e., the reference state R which is designed such that the subset of phase space important to it is the union of the parts of phase space important to A and B. Therefore, an accurate estimate of the relative free energy can be obtained by construction. The authors applied the method to four test systems (dipole inversion, van der Waals interaction perturbation, charge inversion, and water to methanol conversion) and compared the results to thermodynamic integration estimates. In two cases, the enveloping distribution sampling calculation was straightforward. However, in the charge inversion and the water to methanol conversion, Hamiltonian replica-exchange molecular dynamics of the reference state was necessary to observe transitions in the reference state simulation between the parts of phase space important to A and B, respectively. This can be explained by the total absence of phase space overlap of A and B in these two cases.},

abstract = {Understanding protein folding is one of the most challenging problems remaining in molecular biology. In this chapter, a highly parallel replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) method and its application to protein folding are described. The REMD method couples molecular dynamics trajectories with a temperature exchange Monte Carlo process for efficient sampling of the conformational space. A series of replicas are run in parallel at temperatures ranging from the desired temperature to a high temperature at which the replica can easily surmount the energy barriers. From time to time the configurations of neighboring replicas are exchanged and this exchange is accepted or rejected based on a Metropolis acceptance criterion that guarantees the detailed balance. Two example protein systems, one alpha-helix and one beta-hairpin, are used as case studies to demonstrate the power of the algorithm. Up to 64 replicas of solvated protein systems are simulated in parallel over a wide range of temperatures. The simulation results show that the combined trajectories in temperature and configurational space allow a replica to overcome free energy barriers present at low temperatures. These large-scale simulations also reveal detailed results on folding mechanisms, intermediate state structures, thermodynamic properties, and the temperature dependences for both protein systems.},

abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated the Bennett acceptance ratio method is the best asymptotically unbiased method for determining the equilibrium free energy between two end states given work distributions collected from either equilibrium and nonequilibrium data. However, it is still not clear what the practical advantage of this acceptance ratio method is over other common methods in atomistic simulations. In this study, we first review theoretical estimates of the bias and variance of exponential averaging (EXP), thermodynamic integration (TI), and the Bennett acceptance ratio (BAR). In the process, we present a new simple scheme for computing the variance and bias of many estimators, and demonstrate the connections between BAR and the weighted histogram analysis method. Next, a series of analytically solvable toy problems is examined to shed more light on the relative performance in terms of the bias and efficiency of these three methods. Interestingly, it is impossible to conclusively identify a "best" method for calculating the free energy, as each of the three methods performs more efficiently than the others in at least one situation examined in these toy problems. Finally, sample problems of the insertion/deletion of both a Lennard-Jones particle and a much larger molecule in TIP3P water are examined by these three methods. In all tests of atomistic systems, free energies obtained with BAR have significantly lower bias and smaller variance than when using EXP or TI, especially when the overlap in phase space between end states is small. For example, BAR can extract as much information from multiple fast, far-from-equilibrium simulations as from fewer simulations near equilibrium, which EXP cannot. Although TI and sometimes even EXP can be somewhat more efficient in idealized toy problems, in the realistic atomistic situations tested in this paper, BAR is significantly more efficient than all other methods. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Institute of Physics.},

Our approach is closely related to a recently introduced adaptive algorithm that optimizes the simulated statistical ensemble in generalized broad-histogram Monte Carlo simulations. Conventionally, a temperature set is chosen in such a way that the acceptance rates for replica swaps between adjacent temperatures are independent of the temperature and large enough to ensure frequent swaps. In this paper, we show that by choosing the temperatures with a modified version of the optimized ensemble feedback method we can minimize the round-trip times between the lowest and highest temperatures which effectively increases the efficiency of the parallel tempering algorithm. In particular, the density of temperatures in the optimized temperature set increases at the "bottlenecks'' of the simulation, such as phase transitions. In turn, the acceptance rates are now temperature dependent in the optimized temperature ensemble. We illustrate the feedback-optimized parallel tempering algorithm by studying the two-dimensional Ising ferromagnet and the two-dimensional fully-frustrated Ising model, and briefly discuss possible feedback schemes for systems that require configurational averages, such as spin glasses.},

abstract = {The relative binding free energy between two ligands to a specific protein can be obtained using various computational methods. The more accurate and also computationally more demanding techniques are the so-called free energy methods which use conformational sampling from molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations to generate thermodynamic averages. Two such widely applied methods are the thermodynamic integration (TI) and the recently introduced enveloping distribution sampling (EDS) methods. In both cases relative binding free energies are obtained through the alchemical perturbations of one ligand into another in water and inside the binding pocket of the protein. TI requires many separate simulations and the specification of a pathway along which the system is perturbed from one ligand to another. Using the EDS approach, only a single automatically derived reference state enveloping both end states needs to be sampled. In addition, the choice of an optimal pathway in TI calculations is not trivial and a poor choice may lead to poor convergence along the pathway. Given this, EDS is expected to be a valuable and computationally efficient alternative to TI. In this study, the performances of these two methods are compared using the binding of ten tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives to phenylethanolamine N-transferase as an example. The ligands involve a diverse set of functional groups leading to a wide range of free energy differences. In addition, two different schemes to determine automatically the EDS reference state parameters and two different topology approaches are compared.},

abstract = {Enveloping distribution sampling (EDS) is an efficient approach to calculate multiple free-energy differences from a single molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. However, the construction of an appropriate reference-state Hamiltonian that samples all states efficiently is not straightforward. We propose a novel approach for the construction of the EDS reference-state Hamiltonian, related to a previously described procedure to smoothen energy landscapes. In contrast to previously suggested EDS approaches, our reference-state Hamiltonian preserves local energy minima of the combined end-states. Moreover, we propose an intuitive, robust and efficient parameter optimization scheme to tune EDS Hamiltonian parameters. We demonstrate the proposed method with established and novel test systems and conclude that our approach allows for the automated calculation of multiple free-energy differences from a single simulation. Accelerated EDS promises to be a robust and user-friendly method to compute free-energy differe...},
