%% Meta-data block
%% ---------------
%% Each author should be given as a separate \author command.
%%
%% Corresponding authors should have an e-mail given after the author
%% name as an \email command. Phone and fax numbers can be given
%% using \phone and \fax, respectively; this information is optional.
%%
%% The affiliation of authors is given after the authors; each
%% \affiliation command applies to all preceding authors not already
%% assigned an affiliation.
%%
%% The affiliation takes an option argument for the short name.  This
%% will typically be something like "University of Somewhere".
%%
%% The \altaffiliation macro should be used for new address, etc.
%% On the other hand, \alsoaffiliation is used on a per author basis
%% when authors are associated with multiple institutions.

%% The "tocentry" environment can be used to create an entry for the
%% graphical table of contents. It is given here as some journals
%% require that it is printed as part of the abstract page. It will
%% be automatically moved as appropriate.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% \begin{tocentry}

%% Some journals require a graphical entry for the Table of Contents.
%% This should be laid out ``print ready'' so that the sizing of the
%% text is correct.

%% Inside the \texttt{tocentry} environment, the font used is Helvetica
%% 8\,pt, as required by \emph{Journal of the American Chemical}
%% The surrounding frame is 9\,cm by 3.5\,cm, which is the maximum
%% permitted for  \emph{Journal of the American Chemical Society}
%% graphical table of content entries. The box will not resize if the
%% content is too big: instead it will overflow the edge of the box.

%% This box and the associated title will always be printed on a
%% separate page at the end of the document.

%% \end{tocentry}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% The abstract environment will automatically gobble the contents
%% if an abstract is not used by the target journal.
