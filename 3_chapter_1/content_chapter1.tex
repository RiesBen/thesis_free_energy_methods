\begin{summary}
Ensembler is a python package that allows for fast and easy access to the simulation of one and two-dimensional model systems.
It enables method development using small test systems and to deepen the understanding of a broad spectrum of molecular dynamics (MD) methods, starting from basic techniques to enhanced sampling and free-energy calculations.
The ease of installing and using the package increases shareability, comparability, and reproducibility of scientific code developments.
Here, we provide a description of the implementation and usage of the package as well as an application example for free-energy calculation.
The code of Ensembler is freely available on GitHub \textit{https://github.com/rinikerlab/Ensembler} and can directly explored with Binder\cite{Binder2018} or Colab\cite{Bisong2019}.
