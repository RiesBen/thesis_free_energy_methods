In this work, we introduced the Ensembler package as a tool to support teaching of MD simulations and free-energy techniques, and to enable rapid prototyping of new methods using 1D or 2D model systems. The package provides a large set of implemented methods for comparison. The open-source basis, the lean structure, and the simplicity of Python3 form a convenient and efficient framework. The code examples and application example for free-energy calculation highlight the ease of using Ensembler. With this, Ensembler can contribute to improving the shareability, comparability, and reproducibility for method development in our field.
