This study reports the recent developments for the multistate free-energy method RE-EDS, which omits the definition of alchemical transition paths. The automatic workflow for RE-EDS was improved in robustness, and was applied to estimate the relative binding free energies of five CHK1 inhibitors containing typical core-hopping transformations. This system was investigated previously with FEP+ and QligFEP, allowing for a direct comparison of RE-EDS with state-of-the-art pairwise free-energy methods.
Using different starting configurations representing all end states (SSM approach) in the parameter optimization of the RE-EDS workflow improved the sampling, convergence, and the accuracy of the resulting free-energy differences. The performance of RE-EDS SSM was found to be comparable with FEP+ and QligFEP, and shows that RE-EDS with a ``dual topology" approach can be readily applied to challenging ligand transformations like ring size change, ring opening/closing, and ring extension.

In terms of computational efficiency, the total production run time with RE-EDS ($3.5$~ns per replica) was about a quarter of that reported for FEP+ with this system. As multiple ligands are simulated simultaneously in a single RE-EDS simulation, this sampling enhancement will increase with increasing number of ligands. 
However, the pre-processing phase in the RE-EDS workflow currently uses a relatively large amount of simulation time. Making these steps more efficient will be addressed in future work. In addition, further automatization of the dual topology approach with distance restraints is ongoing.
