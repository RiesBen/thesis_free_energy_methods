The target of the here defined algorithm is, to find a good placement for distance restraints between two molecules $m_i$ and $m_j$ for a Dual topology approach.

%%Assumptions
The following assumptions are made towards this process:
, therefore only rigid areas of the moelcules can be selected like atom-rings.

%%Assumptions
The goal is reached greedily 

In order to reach the target of the algorithm, a set of operations befor the algorithm are required in an applied case.
